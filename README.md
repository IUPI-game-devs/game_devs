# IUPI Game Devs

We first started with a floor using a 3D object, we chose the cube. By using the scaling function we were able to make the height of the cube very small and the length and width were almost the same.![](Images/floor.png)
After this, we went to create the wall of the house. We choose again the cube 3D object and made it so that the height and the length were more of a rectangle. The width of the wall was smaller. After creating one we made it so we could copy and paste to create two more. When it was time to create a door entrance we decided to make it from three cube 3D objects![](Images/door.png)After creating the door entrance we chose to create the upper part of the house between the walls and the roof. Here we took some liberties and rotated the scaled and positioned cubes in a way that made sure it covered the area. ![](Images/wall_to_roof.png)
 Finally, we took one cube 3D object to create a roof. We tried different angles and chose a 60° angle as an appropriate angle to match the aesthetic of the house. Once one was created we copied and pasted and changed the angle to -60°. ![](Images/complete.png) 


### Things we found interesting

Something we found interesting is that the process of moving and creating the element was much easier than we thought. The different ways of manipulating the shapes are also very useful. The limitation of using a cube as the only 3D object is the only thing we found to be hard because of the gap that existed between the wall and the roof. Another thing we could have tried was adding furniture inside. But knowing the time constraints given we think this was a good job. The scaling, rotating, and moving tools seem very basic individually, but when we use them together we can make very interesting things.
